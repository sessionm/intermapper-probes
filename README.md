## SessionM Intermapper Probes

We are happy to provide these probes back to the community.  We have developed these in house to overcome some issues with monitoring devices.

We hope you find these as useful as we do and pull requests are welcome.

### Known Issues

When a trap comes in, the status window for all trap based probes will change regardless.  There is an open feature request with Intermapper to allow filtering/conditionalization of the status window for trap probes
